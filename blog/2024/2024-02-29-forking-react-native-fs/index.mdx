As the year clocked into 2023 [a package](https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs) we depended on exceeded a year without a merge with pull requests stacking. At this point we already had a few patches applied locally with patch package, but we decided to fork the package due to our dependency on it.

It always struck us as a bit odd that a library named "native filesystem access" was responsible for not only filesystem access, but file downloading & uploading. It had grown to be a tad bit too large with support for Windows and a good deal of platform specific features.

The beauty of forking open source is we can take this great base and adapt it to our needs, which started with shrinking the scope of this project & adding a few features. We started with a few goals in mind:

 * Remove the Windows support - We only target iOS and Android
 * Remove the upload support - We have existing functionality for this
 * Introduce [ArrayBuffer](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-blob-jsi-helper) support.
 * Introduce [Android MediaStore](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore) support.

So throughout 2023 and into 2024 we slimmed the repository and pushed some updates introducing [react-native-fs2](https://github.com/sourcetoad/react-native-fs2).

One thing we quickly learned is that taking a plugin under your wing helps you discover so many improvements. One thing we were surprised to see is that the library was leaking resources and not closing them.

With a run of strict mode this became apparent.

StrictMode policy violation: android.os.strictmode.LeakedClosableViolation: A resource was acquired at attached stack trace but never released. See java.io.Closeable for information on avoiding resource leaks.
  	at android.os.StrictMode$AndroidCloseGuardReporter.report(StrictMode.java:2011)
  Caused by: java.lang.Throwable: Explicit termination method 'close' not called
  	at com.rnfs2.RNFSManager.getInputStream(RNFSManager.java:102)

  	at com.facebook.jni.NativeRunnable.run(Native Method)
  	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1012)
```

For a library so wildly used (~500,000 downloads a week) that specialized in file system access it was odd to see it leaking resources. Thankfully with modern React Native having a minimum Android supported version that supported [try-with-resources](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html) allowed us to do some easy cleanup.

The library is close to a drop in replacement, except for the features we removed. We welcome anyone to join our fork if it fits your needs.
