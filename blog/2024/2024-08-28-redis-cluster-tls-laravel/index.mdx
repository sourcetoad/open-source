As a project we built evolved with websockets becoming a far more important feature we wanted to move off of a regular implementation of Redis onto a Redis Cluster to scale for larger usage while giving us the safety of failover and redundancy.

{/* truncate */}

In order to test this we took our `docker-compose.yml` file and set up a few nodes to replicate a cluster that we might have configured in AWS.

```
valkey-cluster-1:
  image: bitnami/valkey-cluster:7.2
  environment:
    - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    - VALKEY_CLUSTER_REPLICAS=0
    - VALKEY_NODES=valkey-cluster-1 valkey-cluster-2 valkey-cluster-3
valkey-cluster-2:
  image: bitnami/valkey-cluster:7.2
  environment:
    - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    - VALKEY_CLUSTER_REPLICAS=0
    - VALKEY_NODES=valkey-cluster-1 valkey-cluster-2 valkey-cluster-3
valkey-cluster-3:
  image: bitnami/valkey-cluster:7.2
  environment:
    - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
    - VALKEY_CLUSTER_REPLICAS=0
    - VALKEY_NODES=valkey-cluster-1 valkey-cluster-2 valkey-cluster-3
    - VALKEY_CLUSTER_CREATOR=yes
```

:::note

While Valkey is not Redis we wanted to take this chance to explore compatibility with the alternative Redis fork.

After these containers booted up we found a [little test php script](https://gist.github.com/michael-grunder/ec1cd54b321c454d63864091ff288401) that can confirm your PhpRedis is working great.

```text

```

Now we had the confidence of a working cluster and re-configured our Laravel installation to point to that cluster. With a single change to our `.env` we refreshed and were met with some crashes.

 * `MOVED 15031 172.18.0.30:6379`

Of course that would be expected. We haven't changed anything yet, so off to the Laravel Docs we went to the [Redis Clusters section](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/redis#clusters). The docs guided you on introducing a `clusters.default` array into your existing `config/database.php` file.

At the time of a base Laravel 12 install. The file would look like this:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Redis Databases
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Redis is an open source, fast, and advanced key-value store that also
| provides a richer body of commands than a typical key-value system
| such as Memcached. You may define your connection settings here.
|
*/

'redis' => [
  'client' => env('REDIS_CLIENT', 'phpredis'),
  'options' => [
    'cluster' => env('REDIS_CLUSTER', 'redis'),
    'prefix' => env('REDIS_PREFIX', Str::slug(env('APP_NAME', 'laravel'), '_').'_database_'),
    'persistent' => env('REDIS_PERSISTENT', false),
  ],
  'default' => [
    'url' => env('REDIS_URL'),
    'host' => env('REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
    'username' => env('REDIS_USERNAME'),
    'password' => env('REDIS_PASSWORD'),
    'port' => env('REDIS_PORT', '6379'),
    'database' => env('REDIS_DB', '0'),
  ],
  'cache' => [
    'url' => env('REDIS_URL'),
    'host' => env('REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
    'username' => env('REDIS_USERNAME'),
    'password' => env('REDIS_PASSWORD'),
    'port' => env('REDIS_PORT', '6379'),
    'database' => env('REDIS_CACHE_DB', '1'),
  ],
],
```

So we worked to add in a new section as described like this:

```php
'clusters' => [
  'default' => [
    [
      'url' => env('REDIS_URL'),
      'host' => env('REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
      'username' => env('REDIS_USERNAME'),
      'password' => env('REDIS_PASSWORD'),
      'port' => env('REDIS_PORT', '6379'),
      'database' => env('REDIS_DB', '0'),
    ],
  ]
]
```

Very quickly we learned this level of configuration was not for us due to the way Laravel operates. If we look at the pseudocode of how Laravel loads a Redis connection we'd see this:

```php
$name = $name ?: 'default';
$options = $this->config['options'] ?? [];

if (isset($this->config[$name])) {
  return $this->resolveConnection($this->config[$name]);
}

if (isset($this->config['clusters'][$name])) {
  return $this->resolveCluster($name);
}

// https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/12.x/src/Illuminate/Redis/RedisManager.php#L104
```

Since we had a `redis.default` block as well as a `redis.clusters.default` block our non-cluster connection was always loaded. The code in this resolve method has not changed in 7 years, but we are thinking that perhaps the loading of the cluster should go ahead of the normal connection. That would mean once you add the optional `clusters` block with connection name - it would win loading if both a cluster and non-cluster connection had the same name.

However, that is also not preferred as that change would mean the instant a code change introduced a `redis.clusters.default` block - it would win. This might explain why this code hasn't changed in almost a decade.

So we rewrote our configuration block slightly to this:

```php
'clusters' => [
  'aws' => [
    [
      'url' => env('REDIS_CLUSTER_URL'),
      'host' => env('REDIS_CLUSTER_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
      'username' => env('REDIS_CLUSTER_USERNAME'),
      'password' => env('REDIS_CLUSTER_PASSWORD'),
      'port' => env('REDIS_CLUSTER_PORT', '6379'),
      'database' => env('REDIS_CLUSTER_DB', '0'),
    ],
  ],
],
```

This gave us 2 major advantages:

1. We could deploy this change without configuring the cluster with no change.
2. We could leverage a different env for cluster and non-cluster in case we had to revert quickly.

The downside to this is our connection was no longer named `default`. So in order to switch to our cluster connection, we invoked the connection name of `aws` which was shorthand for our ElastiCache Valkey instance in AWS.

Our `.env` to swap to clusters then was roughly:

```text
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis

SESSION_DRIVER=redis
SESSION_CONNECTION=aws

CACHE_STORE=redis
CACHE_PREFIX=alpha_

REDIS_CLUSTER_HOST=clustercfg.project-redis-cluster.xxxxxx.use1.cache.amazonaws.com
REDIS_CLUSTER_PORT=6379
REDIS_PERSISTENCE=true
REDIS_PREFIX=alpha_
REDIS_CACHE_CONNECTION=aws
REDIS_CACHE_LOCK_CONNECTION=aws
REDIS_QUEUE_CONNECTION=aws
```

So lets break this down:

 * Anything `_DRIVER`, `_STORE` or `_CONNECTION` is simply pointing that feature of Laravel to our new Redis Cluster `aws` connection.
 * Anything `REDIS_CLUSTER_` is for configuration of our Redis Cluster.
 * Anything `_PREFIX` is because Redis Clusters does NOT support multiple databases. So we prefix items to prevent collisions on a shared server.
 * `REDIS_PERSISTENCE` keeps Laravel using the same connection instead of opening a connection on each Redis usage.

With all of that we booted up our system and clicked around. We had a few crashes that became apparent when utilizing the cache or queues. These errors were:

 * `Cannot use 'DEL' with redis-cluster`
 * `Cannot use 'EVAL'  with redis-cluster`

So before taking to Google we first checked the [Queue documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/queues#redis) on Laravel and found a call-out.

:::warning

If your Redis queue connection uses a Redis Cluster, your queue names must contain a key hash tag. This is required in order to ensure all the Redis keys for a given queue are placed into the same hash slot:

```php
'redis' => [
  'queue' => env('REDIS_QUEUE', '{default}'),
],
```

:::

So we understood the problem, but with our complex queue system and multiple lower environments on the same cluster we had to get creative to implement this properly. We introduced a new custom `QueueServiceProvider`

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Support\RedisCluster;

class QueueServiceProvider extends \Illuminate\Queue\QueueServiceProvider
{
    protected function registerRedisConnector($manager): void
    {
        $manager->addConnector('redis', function () {
            // @phpstan-ignore-next-line
            return new RedisClusterConnector($this->app['redis']);
        });
    }
}
```

This loaded our custom `RedisClusterConnector`, which was basically a shell to our key override the queue class.

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Support\RedisCluster;

use Illuminate\Queue\Connectors\RedisConnector;

class RedisClusterConnector extends RedisConnector
{
    public function connect(array $config): RedisClusterQueue
    {
        return new RedisClusterQueue(
            redis: $this->redis,
            default: $config['queue'],
            connection: $config['connection'] ?? $this->connection,
            retryAfter: $config['retry_after'] ?? 60,
            blockFor: $config['block_for'] ?? null,
            dispatchAfterCommit: $config['after_commit'] ?? null,
            migrationBatchSize: $config['migration_batch_size'] ?? -1
        );
    }
}
```

Now our custom `RedisClusterQueue` could be loaded.

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Support\RedisCluster;

use Illuminate\Queue\RedisQueue;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;

class RedisClusterQueue extends RedisQueue
{
    public function getQueue($queue): string
    {
        $isCluster = config('queue.connections.redis.connection') === 'aws';

        if ($isCluster) {
            $queueName = ($queue ?: $this->default);
            return sprintf('{queues:%s}', $queueName);
        }

        return parent::getQueue($queue);
    }
}
```

All we had to do was remove the stock loader and load our own.

```php
// Illuminate\Queue\QueueServiceProvider::class,
App\Support\RedisCluster\QueueServiceProvider::class,
```

This code would automatically build a key hash tag based on the queue name. Sure enough with successful queue tests we found the `keys *` command breaking down our naming pattern.

```text
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "local_{queues:default}:notify"
2) "local_{queues:default}"
3) "local_{queues:openai}"
4) "local_{queues:openai}:notify"
5) "local_{queues:openai-moderation}"
6) "local_{queues:openai-moderation}:notify"
127.0.0.1:6379>
```

This was working great

#### Common Errors

##### `Cannot use 'EVAL' with redis-cluster`
* You are missing a key hash tag `{example}` in your Redis key.

##### `MOVED 15031 172.18.0.30:6379`

* You are sending cluster commands, but your connection (PhpRedis) is not in cluster mode.
* Ensure your `.env` / `config/database.php` is configured properly.

##### `Can't communicate with any node in the cluster`

* Your cluster server is unreachable (or requiring SSL) and you aren't providing it.

##### `Couldn't map cluster keyspace using any provided seed`

* Your cluster server is unreachable, generally because its expecting TLS and you aren't sending it.

##### Laravel Horizon won't work with a Cluster

* As of April 28, 2025 - Horizon [does not officially support](https://github.com/laravel/horizon/issues/274#issuecomment-457218217) Redis Clusters.
