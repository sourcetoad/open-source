_A simple-but-flexible utility for executing tasks on intervals and resolving with promises._

As we needed to execute tasks on intervals on ancient TVs we needed an ES5 compatible solution. This library was born out of that need with 0 dependencies.

Built for a variety of modern and legacy environments, this library offers a bit of functionality:

 * Retrying tasks until success
 * Polling until failure
 * Cascading tasks with adapting retry intervals
