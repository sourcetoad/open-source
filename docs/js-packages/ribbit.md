_An api module based around [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch)._

:::danger

This project has been abandoned due to internal swap to [ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky) as our preferred HTTP client based on the Fetch API.

:::

Built out of a need to have organized classes for API calls. This module is a wrapper around the Fetch API that allows for easy creation of API calls and handling of responses. This reduced the boilerplate of code needed for a simple frontend based API call.
