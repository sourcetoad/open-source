_A simple implementation of [Google's Polyline Encoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm) algorithm in PHP._

Bytey was introduced to help with the encoding of polylines for use with Google Maps. It is a simple implementation of the algorithm that is used to encode and decode polylines.

The idea over time was to introduce more algorithms, but the need for this as not arrived.
