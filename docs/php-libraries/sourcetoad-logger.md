_This package allows you to log important events, including what data is viewed by whom._

Created out of a need to audit information for decades in an optimized packed way. With constraints that we had to utilize the existing database this package was born.

It logged more than a regular audit package in a performant way. It logged information such as:

* What data was viewed by who
* What data was changed by who
* Authentication events

This tracked information in tables that with some effort could replay activities made by a user. This was helpful when/if an audit was needed.
