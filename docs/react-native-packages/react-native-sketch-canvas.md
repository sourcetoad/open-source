title: React Native Sketch Canvas
id: react-native-sketch-canvas
---

_A React Native component for drawing by touching on both iOS and Android._

A great project that allows drawing on a canvas with great performance on both iOS & Android. Unfortunately, as time went on the package was not maintained, and we forked it in early 2020 to keep it up to date with React Native.

We have added a few features/fixes to the library, including:

 * A full rewrite into TypeScript.
 * Revamp a test suite (both unit and e2e).
 * Rewrite into React Native Turbo/Fabric (New Architecture) support.
 * Correct issues with the React Native Interop layer.
 * Correct iOS from degrading quality of images when saving.
 * Support using content URIs on Android as background images.
